# sendRequest:

The provided Java method, sendRequest, is responsible for sending HTTP requests to a specified URL using the RestClient library. The method follows a step-by-step approach to handle various aspects such as authentication, request type, content type, and template rendering.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the method:

1. The method starts by checking if the required parameters are provided, such as the URL, authentication details, and request type. If any required parameters are missing, an error message is returned.
2. The method constructs the complete URL by appending the endpoint to the base URL.
3. A new RestClient instance is created and various configurations are set, including the authentication details, request type, headers, content type, and retry settings.
4. If the request type is POST or PUT, and a template content ID is provided, the method attempts to render the template using the ContentWorker. If the rendering fails, an error message is returned.
5. The method sends the HTTP request using the RestClient instance and checks for any HTTP errors. If an error occurs, an error message is returned.
6. If the request is successful, the method retrieves the response and checks if the content type is "application/pdf". If it is, the response bytes are stored in the result map. Otherwise, the response text is stored.
7. Finally, the method returns the result map containing the HTTP response.


Throughout the method, the code checks for potential errors and provides appropriate error messages to handle different scenarios. It also ensures that the method follows best practices by returning only the necessary information and avoiding any additional code beyond the immediate scope of the code block.
