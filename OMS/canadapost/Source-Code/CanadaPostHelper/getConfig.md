**Code Explantion:**

The getConfig method in the CanadaPostHelper class is responsible for retrieving and preparing the necessary configuration details for integrating with Canada Post's shipping services. The method takes three parameters: delegator (an instance of the Delegator class), carrierPartyId (the ID of the carrier party), and facilityId (the ID of the facility).

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the method:

1. The method initializes an empty Map called config to store the configuration details.
2. It checks if the carrierPartyId is not empty. If it is, the method proceeds to retrieve the configuration details.
3. Inside the try block, it retrieves the external ID of the facility using the WarehouseHelper.getFacility method. It then constructs a StringBuilder called facilityCarrierId by appending the carrierPartyId and the external facility ID.
4. The method queries the SystemMessageRemote entity in the database to find the configuration details for the constructed facilityCarrierId. If a matching record is found, it retrieves the sendUrl, publicKey, username, currentPassword, and usageCode fields from the record and adds them to the config Map.
5. If the usageCode field is not empty, the method checks if it is set to "TEST_MODE". If it is, it adds a testLabel key to the config Map with a value of true. Otherwise, it adds a testLabel key with a value of false.
6. The method then queries the SystemProperty entity in the database to retrieve additional configuration details for the carrierPartyId. It iterates through the retrieved records and adds each systemPropertyId and systemPropertyValue to the config Map.
7. If any exceptions occur during the database queries, they are caught in the catch block, and an error message is logged using the Debug.logError method.
8. If the carrierPartyId is empty, an error message is logged using the Debug.logError method.
9. Finally, the method returns the config Map containing the retrieved configuration details.


This method is used to retrieve the necessary configuration details for integrating with Canada Post's shipping services, such as the API endpoint URL, authentication credentials, and other relevant information. The retrieved configuration details are then used in the integration logic to send requests to Canada Post's API and process the responses.
