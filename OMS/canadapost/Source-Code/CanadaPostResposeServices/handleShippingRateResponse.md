**Code Explantion:**

The handleShippingRateResponse method in the CanadaPostResponseServices class is responsible for parsing and processing the response from Canada Post's shipping rate API. It takes a JSON string as input and returns a Map containing the parsed shipping rate information.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of what the method does:

1. The method initializes an empty Map called result to store the final result. It also initializes other necessary variables such as rateResponse, responseMap, and shippingRateList.
2. It checks if the jsonString is not empty. If it is, the method proceeds to parse the JSON string using the JSONObject and JsonSlurper classes.
3. The parsed JSON response is stored in the responseMap. The method then checks if there are any error messages in the response. If there are, it returns an error message using the ServiceUtil.returnError method.
4. If there are no error messages, the method retrieves the shipping rate information from the response and stores it in the rateResponse Map.
5. Inside a try block, the method extracts the necessary shipping rate details from the rateResponse Map and stores them in a new shippingRate Map. It also converts the shipping estimate amount from a string to a Double using the ObjectType.simpleTypeConvert method.
6. The extracted shipping rate details are added to the shippingRate Map.
7. The shippingRate Map is added to the shippingRateList.
8. Finally, the shippingRateList is added to the result Map under the key "rates", and the result Map is returned.

The method does not return any additional code beyond the immediate scope of the code block. It only processes the JSON response and returns the parsed shipping rate information.
