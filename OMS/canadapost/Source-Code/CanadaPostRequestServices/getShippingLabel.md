**Code Explantion:**

The selected code snippet is part of the getShippingLabel method in the CanadaPostIntegrationServices.java file. This method is responsible for initiating the process of generating a shipping label for a given shipment using the Canada Post integration services.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The method starts by retrieving the necessary details from the context and delegator.
2. It then calls the getShippingDetails method from the ShippingAggregatorHelper class to retrieve the shipping details for the given shipment.
3. If there's an error in retrieving the shipping details, the method returns an error message.
4. The method extracts the carrier party ID and other necessary details from the shipping details response.
5. It creates a new service context and sets the carrier party ID in it.
6. The method then runs the createContractShipment service synchronously using the dispatcher. This service is responsible for creating a contract shipment on Canada Post.
7. If there's an error in creating the contract shipment, the method returns an error message.
8. The method extracts the shipping label map and label PDF link from the response of the createContractShipment service.
9. It retrieves the image of the label PDF using the getArtifact service from the ShippingAggregatorHelper class.
10. If there's an error in retrieving the label image, the method returns an error message.
11. The method updates the label data in the shipping label map with the retrieved image bytes.
12. It also updates the shipment package sequence ID in the shipping label map with the corresponding value from the shipping details response.
13. Finally, the method processes the shipping label response using the processShippingLabelResponse method from the ShippingAggregatorHelper class. If there's an error in processing the response, the method returns an error message.
14. If all the steps are successful, the method returns a success message.


This code snippet demonstrates the overall process of generating a shipping label using the Canada Post integration services. It handles various error scenarios and ensures that the necessary details are retrieved and processed correctly.
