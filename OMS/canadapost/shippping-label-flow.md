# Generating a Shipping Label using the Canada Post Plugin

The complete flow and working to generate a shipping label from start to end in the source code, using the Canada Post plugin, would involve the following steps:

## 1. Get Shipping Details
The first step is to gather the necessary details about the shipment, such as origin and destination addresses, packages, and other relevant information. These details are then used to fetch shipping rates and labels from Canada Post.

## 2. Get Shipping Rates
- The `getShippingRate` API is called with the shipment details as input.
- The plugin sends a request to Canada Post to fetch the shipping rates for the given shipment and carrier.
- Canada Post processes the request and returns the shipping rates.
- The plugin processes the response and returns the rates to the calling function.

## 3. Get Shipping Label
- The `getShippingLabel` API is called with the shipment details as input.
- The plugin first fetches the necessary configuration details for the carrier and facility.
- It then prepares the context for creating a contract shipment with Canada Post.
- The plugin sends a request to Canada Post to create the contract shipment.
- Canada Post processes the request and returns the confirmation.
- After the contract shipment is created, the plugin prepares the context for fetching the shipping label from Canada Post.
- The plugin sends a request to Canada Post to fetch the shipping label.
- Canada Post processes the request and returns the shipping label as a binary PDF.
- The plugin converts the PDF to a format suitable for display or storage, such as PNG.
- The plugin processes the response and returns the shipping label to the calling function.

## 4. Create Contract Shipment
- The `createContractShipment` API is called with the shipment details as input.
- The plugin prepares the context for creating a contract shipment with Canada Post.
- The plugin sends a request to Canada Post to create the contract shipment.
- Canada Post processes the request and returns the confirmation.
- The plugin processes the response and returns the confirmation to the calling function.

## 5. Get Artifact
- The `getArtifact` API is called with the label PDF link and other relevant details as input.
- The plugin prepares the context for fetching the shipping label from Canada Post.
- The plugin sends a request to Canada Post to fetch the shipping label.
- Canada Post processes the request and returns the shipping label as a binary PDF.
- The plugin processes the response and returns the shipping label to the calling function.

## 6. Store Shipping Label
After the shipping label is generated, it can be stored in a database, displayed on a webpage, or used for any other purpose.

## Summary
The complete flow and working of generating a shipping label from start to end in the source code, using the Canada Post plugin, would involve the interaction between the plugin and Canada Post's APIs, as well as the processing and handling of the responses received from Canada Post.

Please note that the provided code snippet is a part of the plugin and contains the implementation of the `getShippingLabel` and `createContractShipment` APIs. The complete plugin code would include additional functionalities and configurations.
